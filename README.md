**Importance of jailbreaking and its benefits**

Jailbreaking is the most helpful thing in the world since Apple restricts the flexibility of iPhone features; consumers cannot use the iPhone as freely as an Android smartphone. Furthermore, most iOS versions include security flaws, and hackers can gain access to sensitive data on iDevices to fix them. The only solution is to update the iOS version to the latest, but the user still has Apple limits, which must be lifted by jailbreaking your smartphone. Also, after jailbreaking, you can address security vulnerabilities by installing the necessary tweaks.

Once you jailbreak the iDevice, you can install Cydia or Sileo, like the Jailbreak Package Manager. Most of the time, the package manager will install automatically via the Jailbreak tool. The package manager contains tweaks, Games, themes, and many more applications. 

After jailbreaking your iDevice, you can change the iPhone Theme, Home Screen, and Widgets and customize the iPhone home screen. You can also install tweaked and modified apps and games not in the Apple App Store. 

You can also free install the Pro version of the tweaked apps and install iPhone Call recorder-like software using Cydia or Sileo-like package manager. 

This Guide will help you explore iOS 18 jailbreak possibilities and alternatives and review the compatibility status of various jailbreak tools.
